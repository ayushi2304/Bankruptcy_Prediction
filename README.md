Also clearly interpret the model parameters.

Solution

Process

Importing the dataset

Importing Necessary libraries 

Checking whether the dataset is Balanced or not

Checkeing for Missing Values,Duplicate values, Outliers 

Building the models

feature engineering

Significance of IV-Accuracy+hypertuning parameter(F1score,Precision,recall) 

Balancing of data using SMOTE & Classification matrix change 

Outlier Detection-Isolation forest/Local Outlier Factor
